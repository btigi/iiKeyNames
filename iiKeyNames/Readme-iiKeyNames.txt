+) Section 1. About
===================
  The Key Names Mod is address the issue of keys in BG2:ToB. Throughout the game, there are several doors that can only be opened by using a specific key item. Some of these doors remove the key item after the door is opened, others leave the key in the players inventory, with no indication it has been used (and is therefore most likely not needed).

The Key Names Mod simply alters the names of key items to indicate whether they have been used, or are yet to be used, depending on the state of the door they are intended for. Key items are left in the players inventory after use, with a name change to indicate the key item has been used - it's then up to the player to decide what to do with the key item (keep it, junk it, sell it etc), rather than it 'dissapearing'.


+) Section 2. (un)Installation
==============================
The Key Name Mod is distributed using the WeiDU distribution package. To install, unzip the iiKeyNames(xx).zip file (where xx represents the version number of the release), to the BG2 main directory. Then run the "Setup-iiKeyNames.exe" file, and follow the on-screen prompts. 

To uninstall re-run the "Setup-iiKeyNames.exe" file, and follow the on-screen prompts, selecting "Uninstall" as required.


+) Section 3. Known Issues
==========================
The mod assumes that each key items opens a single door. This may not be the case (some items seem to open two or more doors), though as the affected key items would originally be removed by the first door opened, this isn't a major issue.

Some key items will still be removed from the players inventory after opening doors. This is caused by dialog or script, which this mod does not affect.
